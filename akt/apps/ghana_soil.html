    <h2>The AKT Ghana Soil Knowledgebase</h2>

<p>This section will use the Soil knowledge base from the Wassa Amenfi district to examine farmers’
knowledge of soil properties that change over time.
</p>

<h3>Summary of the contents of the knowledge base</h3>
<div id="kb_report1" style="width:500px; height:600px; overflow:both; border:solid 1px #808080;"></div>

<p>
Farmers at the five field locations used a number of different terms to refer to soil fertility:
<table style="width:500px; border:solid 2px black; background:#e0e0e0;">
    <tr><td>Twi</td><td>English translation</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Asase okyene adee</td><td>Land that is good for crop growth/fertile</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Asase a enyine</td><td>Land that is well grown (has had a lot of vegetation on the fallow)</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ahooden</td><td>Strength</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Seradee</td><td>Fat</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Asase mu seradee/ahooden asa</td><td>The fat/strength in the land is finished</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ahooden fofro aba m</td><td>New strength has come into (the land)</td></tr>
</table>
</p>

<p>It became apparent during the research that farmers have an aggregate concept of soil fertility. They
frequently associate fertile soil with soil that has a high organic matter content and refer to fertile soil as
land that crops grow and yield well one. This was sometimes confusing as e.g. land that is good for rice
is not good for cocoa and vice versa. Fertile soil is also associated with land that requires little weeding.
Although farmers hold an aggregate concept of soil fertility they are aware of the following:
<ul>
    <li>Soil texture</li>
    <li>Soil moisture</li>
    <li>Soil fertility (meaning soil nutrients or else aggregate soil fertility – it was sometimes
difficult to distinguish between the two)</li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3>1. Soil fertility indicators</h3>
<p>
There are 2 statements about how farmers tell if soil is fertile or infertile:
The statement numbers (e.g. 4 and 5) refer to the statement number in the knowledge base.

<p>4: the soil fertility is fertile if<br/>
• the topiah leaves colour is green and the topiah leaves size is broad or<br/>
• the adupren leaves colour is green and the adupren fruit size is big or<br/>
• the clearing of land amount is complete and the burning of land amount is complete and the
topiah presence is sparse or<br/>
• the asogyere presence is a_lot or fertility indicator presence is positive
</p>
<p>
5: the soil fertility is infertile if<br/>
• the topiah leaves colour is yellow and the topiah leaves size is small or<br/>
• the growth of topiah amount is stunted or<br/>
• the adupren fruit size is small or the adupren leaves size is small or<br/>
• the infertility indicator presence is positive
</p>
</p>

<p>
Farmers use plant growth and the presence of particular plant species as indicators of fertile soil.
Topiah (Chromolaena odorata) is the most prevalent weed and fallow species in the forest and
transition zones of Ghana.</p>

<p>From these statements it becomes clear that topiah, as a species capable of spreading rapidly onto an
abandoned fallow, aids rapid regeneration of the land. However its persistence increases the frequency of
weeding necessary on land that has been fallowed for less than 6 years.</p>

<h3>2. Factors influencing soil fertility</h3>
<p>
19: an increase in duration of continuous_cropping of land causes a decrease in fertility of soil<br/>
69: application of inorganic_fertiliser causes an increase in fertility of soil<br/>
20: decomposition of Gliricidia_sp. leaves causes an increase in fertility of soil<br/>
21: decomposition of Leucaena_sp. leaves causes an increase in fertility of soil<br/>
22: decomposition of Acacia_sp. leaves causes an increase in fertility of soil<br/>
151: cultivation of cowpea causes an increase in fertility of soil<br/>
40: an increase in content of soil organic_matter causes an increase in fertility of soil<br/>
104: the fallow maturity is mature causes the soil fertility is fertile<br/>
91: upland surface_runoff soil causes a decrease in fertility of upland soil<br/>
92: upland surface_runoff soil causes an increase in fertility of lowland soil<br/>
153: the asase_tuntum texture is loose causes the soil fertility is fertile
</p>

<p>
Farmers are aware that :<br/>
• Leguminous tree and crop species increase soil fertility but do not know about the mechanisms
involved.<br/>
• Decomposition of organic matter increases soil fertility.<br/>
• Erosion on sloping land depletes the upper slopes, but adds fertility to lower slopes.<br/>
</p>

<h3>3. Influence of soil fertility</h3>
<p>Other statements refer to factors resulting from an increase or decrease in soil fertility:<br/>
3: the replanting of cassava frequency is 3 times if the soil fertility is fertile<br/>
196: a decrease in fertility of soil causes an increase in duration of fallow<br/>
13: the soil fertility is infertile causes a decrease in yield of crop<br/>
68: an increase in fertility of soil causes an increase in amount of growth of crop<br/>
14: the soil fertility is infertile causes grass growth weeds<br/>
45: the soil fertility is infertile causes an increase in amount of growth of nsensan<br/>
52: the soil fertility is infertile causes the growth of plant amount is stunted
</p>

<p>
• Increased soil fertility results in improved plant and crop growth and yields.<br/>
• Infertile soil results in stunted plant growth and more weeds, particularly grass weeds.<br/>
• Farmers’ actions are also influenced by soil fertility, cassava can be cropped for longer on fertile
soil, on infertile soil farmers leave the fallow for longer.
